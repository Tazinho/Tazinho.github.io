## talk1 summary: tidyverse talk von hadley auf rstudio conf

quelle: rstudio talk hadley: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/data-science-in-the-tidyverse/

goal:solve complex problems by combining simple uniform pieces
-consistent functions
  - a command function performs an action (print, plot, write_csv, <-
  - a query function computes a value (summarise, mutate, geom_line)
pipe code
 - first argument is the data
 - the data is the same type across a family of functions
Tidy data is a consistent way of storing data
 - Each dataset goes in a data frame
 - Each variable goes in a column
for list columns use tidy tibbles instead of tidy data frames
biggest difference: tibbles are data frames that are lazy and surely
no character to factor, no partial matching, better support for lists (defining in the creator for example)
- applications: tidy text, sf (successor of the sp) uses list columns, cross validation (with list columns), tidy_quant (tidy financial timeseries), maybe ml with caret (or mlr) pipelearner, ...

4 principles:
1. each function encapsulates one task
2 and is either a query or a command
3. Functions are composed with "%>%"
4. and use tidy tibbles as primary data structure

workflow usually involves naming intermediate results, nesting and the pipe
when working with many data frames it mitght be not alway the best idea

dbi interface for the odbc will be worked on
