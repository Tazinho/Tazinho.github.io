## talk1 summary: tidyverse talk von hadley auf rstudio conf

quelle: rstudio talk hadley:  https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/data-science-in-the-tidyverse/

goal:solve complex problems by combining simple uniform pieces
-consistent functions
  - a command function performs an action (print, plot, write_csv, <-
  - a query function computes a value (summarise, mutate, geom_line)
pipe code
 - first argument is the data
 - the data is the same type across a family of functions
Tidy data is a consistent way of storing data
 - Each dataset goes in a data frame
 - Each variable goes in a column
for list columns use tidy tibbles instead of tidy data frames
biggest difference: tibbles are data frames that are lazy and surely
no character to factor, no partial matching, better support for lists (defining in the creator for example)
- applications: tidy text, sf (successor of the sp) uses list columns, cross validation (with list columns), tidy_quant (tidy financial timeseries), maybe ml with caret (or mlr) pipelearner, ...

4 principles:
1. each function encapsulates one task
2 and is either a query or a command
3. Functions are composed with "%>%"
4. and use tidy tibbles as primary data structure

workflow usually involves naming intermediate results, nesting and the pipe
when working with many data frames it mitght be not alway the best idea

dbi interface for the odbc will be worked on

## talk2 building dashboards with shiny tutorial j cheng

first part joe cheng, server side

what sets a dashboard apart from ohter apps

- automatic updating
- potentially many viewers looking at the same data
- may or may not be interactive
- "Ten foot" user interface (designed to be seen from a distance or from mobile, ...)

techniques:
- 1. reactive file reader/pull functions
- 2. optimizing performance

1. user vs data driven events
invalidate later() is ok but has overhead
- reactivefilereader just looks every i. e. milisecond on the timestamp of a file and the read functions are only called when the timestamp changes.
first argument must be the path to data. but works just for data in files on disk. not for databases or apis
- reactivePoll is 2 functions first is checkfun (httr::head(api) head request for apis to see if anything changed), 2nd is valueFunc both are necessary for api or db data. no data is returned, but a reactive expression that returns a data frame.

how do we filter arrange etc while data changes underneath...
just to understand...it is done more or less automatically

2 performance
- Cache Results
- speed up with logic, parallel or rcpp
- scale hardware up/out
- remove functionality
.maybe rxtools package is coming to handle special functionality for reactivity, but maybe under a different name
.maybe some background job functionality will be included in shiny
.logging was not well introduced via shiny

Userinterface (W. Chang)
1. dynamic (in clientside with html widgets) vs stable dashboards
2. flexdashboard (publish on server, RPubs, RStudoConnect, works with html_widgets, crosstalk and shiny, also auch mit reactive inputs im letzten Fall, galube ich...)
3. shinydashboard
(of course one can build a shiny dashboard without these packages)

deploy to server ,rstudioapps.io, rstudioconnect

## talk 3 happy R users purrr - Tutorial (charlotte wickham)

lapply(people, function(x) length(x$starships))
is equivalent to
map(mtcars, ~ length(.x$starships) # map(.x, .f)

- other types of output
map always returns a list
some helpers for atomic returns use: map_lgl, map_int, map_dbl, map_chr (return has the same length as x). use them to have typestable output.
u can use readr::parse_number for also telling what are NAs when converting to numeric
when you want nothing at all, use a function for its sisde effects: walk()
set names with set_names instead of names of setNames
- other ways of specifying .f
.f can be an integer or string, i.e. f  = "some_name"  instead of .x[["some_name"]]
go in little steps: map(people, "starships") %>% map_int(length)
- other iteration functions

when you have more than one information for a cell. try to use a list column. try to use it inside a tibble instead in a data.frame. when building the tibble from scratch with map, there is no nice functionality to turn the list to a tibble, but you really have to build every column from scratch indepentently...you can use transpose to try it, but at the moment there is no "safe" way to do this in short

convenient functions for missing values map_chr("Species", .null = NA_character_)

use map inside mutate to manipulate list columns inside a tibble/data.frame
...sometimes it's nice to use lookup tables inside map...

collapse a character list column, so that each element is a paseted strings with an appropriate separator (use collapse) -> sth like
mutate(new_col = paste(old_col, collapse = ", "))
so the following should work:
map_chr(old_column, paste(.x, collapse ", ")) # before pasting one can sort and so on of course.

walk is like map, but you get nothing back (you get it back invisible, so you can do some side effect inside a pipe and continue the pipeline in the same go).
side effects = "printing to screen, plotting to gr dev, file manipulation (save, write, move, etc), system calls"

map2 iterates over to listts -> map2(.x, .y, .f)
there are also
walk2, map2_lgl, map2_int, map2_dbl, map2_chr

use map2 for writing, downloading etc different objects to different files...
use pmap, it is like map and map2, just for 3 or more arguments
use invoke map to apply many different functions to one argument

many helpers for lists and functions..
safely takes a function and returns a function
transpose takes and returns a list...
the combination of the last two is very good for dealing with errorcatching...

## talk 13 Writing Readable Code with Pipes – Bob Rudis

- 81 Packages on Cran that export the pipe operator
- use ndjson for faster json parsing
- use anytime for faster date time stuff
- use stop_for_status() to look into the risky data stuff within the pipeline
- use list.files %>% map_df

## talk 14 (d1) Mapping in R with Leaflet – Bhaskar Karambelkar

- based on version 0.7 of the leaflet javascript library.
The most actual one is version 1.0
- pacakges of the presentation: sp, rgdal, rgeos, raster, rmapshaper, tigris, acs, sf,  mapview, geojson, geojsonio
- the wholel grafic is rendered as a svg
- many controls, buttons and plugins (the latter is outstanding and special within leaflet).

Adv. Concepts
- various panes with different visibility. Order of mapping is not important, cause this is done internally.
- u can catch events for html stuff or shiny
- u can use groups and players
- huge mass of plugins, a whole ecosystem (like also d3 has).

-leafletProxy is used within shiny to add sth to already existing maps
- leaflet/adxxx have options arguments, which can be quite nice
- you can use tiles from cartodb
- addLayersControl("Dark", "Light")
- new markers: addAwesomeMarkers, addLabelOnlyMarkers

- more hover options, also for polygons...
- better and more projections like mercator...
- use shiny to capture events,..

- leaflet.extras, for added plugins...
- at the moment on github. on cran soon...
- leaflet will be stable
- leaflet.extras will be dynamic

- topojason for dynamic chloropleth maps is awesome...
- for now everything thrown into leaflet has to be in lat/lng. however this is discussed and might be more flexible someday

## talk 24 (d2) Opinionated Analysis Development Hilary Parker
~ try to blame the process and not the person -> when errors occur, optimise the process

## talk 33 (d2) R’s Role in Data Science – Joseph Rickert

distinction of data engineering vs data science
"most of the time engineers know what they are doing"

ds:bring scientific method into engineering
...

## Talk 34 (d2): All Things R and RStudio, Q & A with J.J. Allaire, Hadley Wickham & Joe Cheng, Moderator: Joseph Rickert

upcoming:
interface to tensorflow deep learning and machine learning
thoughts about default parallelization...problems about api, because parallelisation ways differ so much on different os'ses.

Needed in base R:
64bit integers
out of memory vectors (pointers)
