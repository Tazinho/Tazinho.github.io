## talk1 summary: tidyverse talk von hadley auf rstudio conf

quelle: rstudio talk hadley:  https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/data-science-in-the-tidyverse/

goal:solve complex problems by combining simple uniform pieces
-consistent functions
  - a command function performs an action (print, plot, write_csv, <-
  - a query function computes a value (summarise, mutate, geom_line)
pipe code
 - first argument is the data
 - the data is the same type across a family of functions
Tidy data is a consistent way of storing data
 - Each dataset goes in a data frame
 - Each variable goes in a column
for list columns use tidy tibbles instead of tidy data frames
biggest difference: tibbles are data frames that are lazy and surely
no character to factor, no partial matching, better support for lists (defining in the creator for example)
- applications: tidy text, sf (successor of the sp) uses list columns, cross validation (with list columns), tidy_quant (tidy financial timeseries), maybe ml with caret (or mlr) pipelearner, ...

4 principles:
1. each function encapsulates one task
2 and is either a query or a command
3. Functions are composed with "%>%"
4. and use tidy tibbles as primary data structure

workflow usually involves naming intermediate results, nesting and the pipe
when working with many data frames it mitght be not alway the best idea

dbi interface for the odbc will be worked on

## talk2 building dashboards with shiny tutorial j cheng

first part joe cheng, server side

what sets a dashboard apart from ohter apps

- automatic updating
- potentially many viewers looking at the same data
- may or may not be interactive
- "Ten foot" user interface (designed to be seen from a distance or from mobile, ...)

techniques:
- 1. reactive file reader/pull functions
- 2. optimizing performance

1. user vs data driven events
invalidate later() is ok but has overhead
- reactivefilereader just looks every i. e. milisecond on the timestamp of a file and the read functions are only called when the timestamp changes.
first argument must be the path to data. but works just for data in files on disk. not for databases or apis
- reactivePoll is 2 functions first is checkfun (httr::head(api) head request for apis to see if anything changed), 2nd is valueFunc both are necessary for api or db data. no data is returned, but a reactive expression that returns a data frame.

how do we filter arrange etc while data changes underneath...
just to understand...it is done more or less automatically

2 performance
- Cache Results
- speed up with logic, parallel or rcpp
- scale hardware up/out
- remove functionality
.maybe rxtools package is coming to handle special functionality for reactivity, but maybe under a different name
.maybe some background job functionality will be included in shiny
.logging was not well introduced via shiny

Userinterface (W. Chang)
1. dynamic (in clientside with html widgets) vs stable dashboards
2. flexdashboard (publish on server, RPubs, RStudoConnect, works with html_widgets, crosstalk and shiny, also auch mit reactive inputs im letzten Fall, galube ich...)
3. shinydashboard
(of course one can build a shiny dashboard without these packages)

deploy to server ,rstudioapps.io, rstudioconnect
